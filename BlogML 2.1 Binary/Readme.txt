BlogML is an XML format for storing the entire content of a blog.  You can use BlogML as 
a way to archive the contents of blogs or to act as a standard format for transferring 
content from one blog to another - this could include migrating a blog from one blogging 
engine to another.  There are currently several blogging engines that provide support 
for BlogML.
A blogging tool is BlogML support when it has both an Exporter and Importer for it.
